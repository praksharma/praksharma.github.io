### [EG-3066](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EG-3066&ayr=22/23&psl=TB2&detailOnly=false) : Industry 4.0
  * **Term(s) Taught:** Jan - Apr 2022, Jan - Apr 2023, Jan - May 2024
  * **Module coordinator:** Dr JS Thompson
  * **Data analytics laboratory:** Assisted students with two projects. The first focused on predictive maintenance of jet engines using various clustering techniques. The second involved classifying human activities (e.g., walking, climbing stairs, sitting, standing, laying) based on accelerometer and gyroscope data.
  * **Virtual reality labs:**  Guided students in basic usage of VR headsets. Organized applications simulating maintenance of a car, operation of a ship deck, and management of a warehouse.

### [EGIM02](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EGIM02&ayr=21%2F22&psl=TB1&detailOnly=false) : Advanced Computational Methods for Engineers
  * **Term Taught:** Sep - Dec 2021
  * **Module coordinator:** Dr Feihu Zhao
  * **Computer labs:** Provided guidance to students in completing exercises on a variety of numerical mathematics topics in MATLAB. This included instructing on solving ordinary differential equations using Euler and Runge-Kutta methods, and solving convection-diffusion problems using different finite difference and finite volume schemes.
  * **Exam Grading:** Responsible for grading the exam sheets, assessing students' understanding and application of numerical methods and computational techniques covered in the course.

### [EG-219](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EG-219&ayr=21%2F22&psl=TB1&detailOnly=false) : Statistical Methods in Engineering
  * **Term(s) Taught:** Sep - Dec 2021
  * **Module coordinator:** Dr Claire Barnes
  * **Computer labs:** Provided guidance to students in completing of a number of projects: race car drag coefficients, wind speed estimation, biocomposite breaking strength, coastal defence analysis, statistical inference, road surface durability study, linear regression, wave power generation, strength testing in construction material.

### [EGA229](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EGA229&ayr=22/23&psl=TB1%2B2&detailOnly=false) : Experimental Studies - Aerospace
  * **Term(s) Taught:** Jan - Apr 2022
  * **Module coordinator:** Dr Z Jelic
  * **Lab experiment:** Provided guidance to students in hands-on laboratory sessions focused on vibration studies of a cantilever beam. My role involved helping them understand and conduct three key tests: Decay Test, Broadband Test, and Stepped Sine Test. This assistance was crucial in enabling students to practically apply theoretical concepts, observe the dynamic responses of the beam under various conditions, and gain a deeper understanding of the complexities in aerospace engineering vibration analysis.

### [EGA324](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EGA324&ayr=23/24&psl=TB1%2B2&detailOnly=false) : Mechanical Engineering Practice
  * **Term(s) Taught:** Sep - Dec 2022
  * **Module coordinator:** Dr AA Fahmy Abdo
  * **Computer labs:** Assisted students with three projects. This included experiments on stresses in bolted joints, fluid dynamics in a subsonic wind tunnel, and stress concentration features carried out in ANSYS Mechanical and Fluent.

### [EGA366](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EGA366&ayr=24/25&psl=TB1&detailOnly=false) : Kinematics and Programming for Robot
  * **Term(s) Taught:** Sep - Dec 2022
  * **Module coordinator:** Dr S Li
  * **Computer labs:** Assisted students with simulating mobile robotic cars in MATLAB Simulink. The coursework covers forward and inverse kinematics, differential kinematics including linear and angular velocities and accelerations. It also included trajectory planning using polynomial and LSPB methods, and understanding robot controllers in both open and closed-loop contexts.

### [EGA334](https://intranet.swan.ac.uk/catalogue/default.asp?type=moddetail&dept=any&mod=EGA334&ayr=23/24&psl=TB1&detailOnly=false) : Mechanical Engineering Design 3
  * **Term(s) Taught:** Sep - Dec 2023
  * **Module coordinator:** Dr M Togneri
  * **Computer labs:** Assisted the students with analysis and design of a remote controlled car in SolidWorks. The students were required to create CAD models of crash structure, roll cage, steering, chassis and wheels. Later the parts were printed and marking was based on the weight and size limits, roll cage strength, crash structure protection from crashes, time to traverse 10m, turning ability through simple course.
