I am currently a Data Scientist at the [Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA)](https://www.uk-atomic-energy.org.uk/). I recently completed my PhD in Mechanical Engineering at the [Zienkiewicz Institute for Modelling, Data and AI](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science-and-engineering/research/zienkiewicz-institute-for-modelling-data-ai/) at [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/). I obtained my M.Sc. in Computational Mechanics from Swansea University in 2021 and my B.Tech. in Civil Engineering from [APJ Abdul Kalam Technological University](https://aktu.ac.in/) in 2019. My research interests include physics-informed neural networks, neural operators, and software development in Python.

In my free time, I like to play first person shooter games, GUI development and CAD modelling. I am an advocate of open-source software, at the same time I am an active member of [r/LinuxSucks](https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxsucks/). I also like to travel to remote places.
