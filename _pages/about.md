I am a PhD student in [Zienkiewicz Institute for Modelling, Data and AI](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/science-and-engineering/research/zienkiewicz-institute-for-modelling-data-ai/) at [Swansea University](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/). I obtained a M.Sc. in Computational Mechanics from Swansea University in 2021. I received my B.Tech. in Civil Engineering from [APJAKTU](https://aktu.ac.in/) in 2019. My current research interest includes physics-informed neural networks, neural operator and software development in python.

Currently, I am working on physics based solution reconstruction of heat transfer and inverse scattering problems. In my free time, I like to play first person shooter games, GUI development and CAD modelling. I am an advocate of open-source software.
